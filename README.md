Deep-Image-Analogy
==============================

Unofficial,PyTorch version of Deep Image Analogy.https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.01088. 
This project focuses on documentation of the project , and simplifying the structure.
A blog post on it is coming soon. 

### Some Outputs (The two images in the middle are generated by the Algorithm) 
![](demos/Demo.png?raw=true)

### Some other interesting (one way) outputs
![](demos/Ann_Avatar.png?raw=true)




## This Project uses python3.6 and Cuda

### To Install Dependencies: 
be in the root directory and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` 

### To See Step by Step working of Project : 
Run the Deep Image Analogy.ipynb file in the notebooks folder (using jupyter)

### To run project:
cd into src , and run `python Deep-Img-Analogy.py INPUT_IMG_A INPUT_IMG_BB OUTPUT_IMG` 

## Note 
This project uses Adam as optimizer instead of LBFGS. LBFGS was giving really poor results.
